# GenAI for Packaging Layout Interpretation


This project set out to create a GenAI-assisted pipeline that could analyze images of luxury
pen box packaging and translate them into structured layout representations. The approach
combines computer vision techniques with AI to detect components, understand their
spatial relationships, and output structured data that could be used by downstream
applications.


## Model Recommendation
### Ultralytics -	yolo11n.pt
I used a custom YOLO-based model yolo11n.pt as the core object detection engine for this project. This model was specifically trained on packaging layout data to detect components such as labels, icons, text blocks, and structured zones with high accuracy and speed.

* **Nano-sized (fast + lightweight)**:
    Based on the nano variant of YOLO, yolo11n.pt is optimized for speed and small size, making it ideal for real-time applications and deployment in limited-resource environments (like Streamlit or edge devices).

* **Custom-trained for layout interpretation**:
    Unlike general-purpose YOLO weights, this model is fine-tuned on domain-specific data, allowing it to accurately extract layout structures from packaging images.

* **High performance on domain-specific tasks**:
    The model provides superior accuracy and precision in identifying structured visual elements compared to out-of-the-box models.
### Dataset Creation and Training
I created a custom dataset by annotating images of luxury pen boxes with the following
component classes:
* Pen
* Insert (the internal holder)
* Base (bottom part of box)
* Lid (top part of box)
* Outer (external structure)
The model was trained for 100 epochs, achieving strong performance:
* Overall mAP50 (mean Average Precision at IoU 0.5): 0.76
* Component-specific performance:
    * Insert: 0.874 mAP50
    * Base: 0.913 mAP50
    * Lid: 0.650 mAP50
    * Outer: 0.791 mAP50
    * Pen: 0.573 mAP50

## Performance Analysis
The model performed particularly well on structural elements like the base and insert but
had lower accuracy for pen detection. This makes sense as pens can vary significantly in
appearance, while structural components tend to have more consistent shapes and
positions.

## Test Image Results
The image shows the output from our trained YOLOv11n model on a luxury pen box. As
visible in the visualization, the model successfully detected and classified the key
components of the packaging:
The detection results demonstrate the model's ability to identify multiple packaging
elements simultaneously, with bounding boxes indicating each component's location and
dimensions. The model achieved reasonable confidence scores across all components:

    • The lid (0.54 confidence) is correctly identified as the top portion of the red box
    • The insert (0.57 confidence) is accurately detected as the black velvet component
    holding the pen
    • The pen itself (0.37 confidence) is identified despite its reflective metallic surface
    • The outer structure (0.55 confidence) is properly detected as the packaging
    boundary

Notably, the model performs better on structural components with consistent shapes
(insert, lid, outer) compared to the pen, which aligns with our training metrics where pen
detection showed lower mAP scores. This visualization confirms that our object detection
approach can effectively decompose a packaging image into its constituent parts, forming
the foundation for our structured layout representation.
## Structure Representation
JSON Layout Format
Detection results are transformed into a structured JSON format containing:

### Spatial Relationship Analysis
Beyond simple detection, the system calculates relative positioning between components.
For example, the pen's position relative to the insert is calculated by comparing their center
coordinates and classifying the relationship as "centre," "left corner," or "right corner."
#### User Interface
I developed a Streamlit application that allows users to:
* Upload images of pen boxes
* Process them through the trained model
* Visualize the detection results
* View and download the structured JSON representation

### AI Roadmap for Future Development

#### Image Preprocessing
AI can be used to enhance image quality, remove background noise, and normalize image
color and lighting conditions. This step improves detection accuracy downstream.
#### Object Detection & Segmentation
Modern computer vision models like YOLOv11 or Detectron2 can detect packaging
components such as:
* Outer box (lid and base)
* Internal insert (pen holder)
* Accessories or dividers
These models can also return bounding boxes and confidence scores.
#### Material and Texture Identification
AI models trained on labeled material data (e.g., PU leather, velvet, paperboard) can classify
the visible surfaces of packaging components. Tools like CLIP or vision transformers can be
adapted for this.
#### Dimension & Position Estimation
Based on bounding box coordinates and relative image size, AI can estimate component
dimensions and infer relative positions (e.g., "pen is centered inside insert").
#### Layout Structuring
Post-detection, AI can translate image-based results into structured formats (e.g., JSON or
Python dictionaries) that represent packaging layout data — component types, materials,
and layout hierarchy.
#### Generative Design
With ControlNet or Stable Diffusion, GenAI could visualize or even suggest new packaging
designs based on an interpreted layout.
#### Generative Capabilities
The pipeline could be extended with generative components:
* Layout Generation: Using diffusion models to suggest design variations
* 3D Model Creation: Converting detected layouts to CAD-compatible 3D models
* Design Optimization: Recommending improvements based on material usage or
structural integrity
#### Required Training Data
To evolve the system, we would need:
* Diverse Packaging Examples: Thousands of images covering various styles and
configurations
* Material Samples: Labeled examples of different packaging materials
* CAD-Paired Dataset: Images matched with their corresponding design files
* Dimension Ground Truth: Actual measurements paired with visual data
#### Validation Approach
#### How Would You Validate the Outputs?
Validation ensures reliability and accuracy. It can happen at several levels:
#### Detection Validation
* Use standard metrics like IoU (Intersection over Union), precision, and recall
* Check model confidence scores
Layout Validation
* Verify if the spatial relationships and component types are logically consistent (e.g.,
insert should be inside base, not outside)
* Rule-based assertions using layout metadata
Material Validation
* Compare AI-predicted materials with human-labeled textures
* Use confusion matrix to track common misclassifications
Human-in-the-Loop
* Use tools like Streamlit for interactive feedback
* Allow design teams to verify, correct, or override AI outputs
## Conclusion
This prototype demonstrates that GenAI, particularly computer vision models like YOLO, can
effectively interpret packaging layouts from images. The integration of AI and GenAI into the
packaging layout interpretation pipeline holds immense promise — not just for automating
manual tasks, but for redefining how packaging is conceptualized, validated, and even
designed. This project lays the groundwork by demonstrating how object detection and
layout structuring can be achieved using computer vision models like YOLOv8. With further
integration of GenAI tools such as ControlNet and GPT-based systems, we can unlock new
capabilities like generative design, smart validation, and real-time layout recommendations.
By leveraging structured data, high-quality annotations, and domain-specific rules, we move
toward a future where machines don’t just see packaging — they understand it.
